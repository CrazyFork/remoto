# remoto

Ultra-simple but complete RPC ecosystem.

* Simple service definitions written in Go (interfaces and structs)
* Generates servers and clients that makes implementing/consuming easy
* Generates human-readable code
* Lots of [templates](templates) to use today

## Who is Remoto for?

Remoto is for teams who want to:

* Deliver mobile and web RPC services
* Automate SDK and client library generation
* Stick with simple and familiar technology

## In this document

* [Remoto Definition Files](#remoto-definition-files) - An overview of the Remoto definition files
* [Remoto command](#remoto-command) - The `remoto` command line tool

# Remoto definition files

Definition files are Go source with `.remoto.go` file extension.

An example definition looks like this:

```go
package project

// Greeter provides greeting services.
type Greeter interface {
	// Greet generates a greeting.
	Greet(*GreetRequest) *GreetResponse
}

// GreetRequest is the request for Greeter.GreetRequest.
type GreetRequest struct {
	Name string
}

// GreetResponse is the response for Greeter.GreetRequest.
type GreetResponse struct {
	Greeting string
}
```

* `package project` - package name can group services
* `type ServiceName interface` - describes an RPC service
* `Greet(*GreetRequest) *GreetResponse` - service method with request and response objects
* `type GreetRequest struct` - describes the request data
* `type GreetResponse struct` - describes the response data

## Rules

* Each service is an `interface`
* Each method is an endpoint
* Methods must take a pointer to request object as its only argument
* Methods must return a pointer to the response object as the result
* Only a subset of Go types are supported: `string`, `float64`, `int`, `bool`, and `struct` types
* Any slices (boundless arrays) of the supported types are also allowed (e.g. `[]string`, `[]bool`, etc.)
* Comments describe the service

## Special types

### Files

Remoto provides the following special types:

* `remototypes.File` - A local or remote file

You can also optionally return `*remototypes.FileResponse` from the service methods, which will describe a 
single binary file that will be streamed to the client.

## Tips

* Avoid importing common types - describe all the required types in a single `.remoto.go` file

# Remoto command

The `remoto` command can be built into your development pipeline to generate source code from
definition files.

## `remoto generate` 

The generate command generates source code from a given template.

```
usage:
	remoto generate definition template -o output-file
```

* `definition` - Path to the definition folder
* `template` - Path to the template to render
* `output-file` - Where to save the output (folders will be created and files will be overwritten without warning)
